# Predicting-Euro-Cup-Results
This project was done during the Euro Cup 2016.
Its a rather straight forward approach that we did using historical data of the matches and Machine learning.
I have added a word file in this repository which describes everything we did so far for prediction.
But the basic workflow of the project is along this line:
*************************
Collected all the football matches played since 2008.
Cleaned up the data according to our needs.
Imported the data into R and created two models and predicted the scores for the upcoming matches.
*************************
I have included all the necessary files required to kick start the project.
We never debugged the project, hence we are not sure how much we overfitted or underfitted the model.
The rest of the instructions are included in the word file.

Best of luck..
