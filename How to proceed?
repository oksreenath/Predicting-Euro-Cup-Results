If you had gone through the code, maybe you would have thought "Oh...wait, I could have done it better"
We would love to hear your ideas, and hopefully we can come up with a better model to predict the results.
And maybe use it to bet and make some cash. ;)
This github repositroy was set up to help beginners (just like me) who wants to take the first step into the machine
learning world.
Happy coding..
